The Bhubaneswar Municipality Corporation (BMC) is responsible for day to day garbage  processing for the garbage generated in and around Bhubaneswar. For this reason they have outsourced  the entire task of garbage processing to a third party. The main motive of this C++ project  is to maintain a database on behalf of  BMC to keep track of the amount of garbage processed every day, month and year along with the type  of garbage. A central supervisor should keep track of the number of vehicles employed by the third  party for garbage loading and unloading along with the maximum loading capacity of each vehicle.
